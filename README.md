ðŸ¤– AI Chatbot with Conversation History and RAG
This is an advanced AI chatbot built using LangChain, designed to remember previous interactions and provide intelligent responses using both conversation history and document-based retrieval (RAG).

âœ¨ Features
Session-Based Memory: Remembers past conversations using RunnableWithMessageHistory.

Multi-Session Support: Handle separate users or sessions with unique histories.

Dynamic Language Prompts: Responds in the language specified by the user.

Context Management: Trims old messages to stay within token limits using trim_messages.

Document Retrieval (RAG): Combines conversation with relevant information from documents using vector similarity.

Async Search Support: Enables faster and scalable document lookups.

ðŸ§± Stack
Language Models: Gemma 2 (via Groq), LLaMA 3 (via Groq)

Embeddings: HuggingFace (MiniLM)

Vector Store: ChromaDB

Frameworks: LangChain, LangChain Community

ðŸ“š Data Sources
Custom documents about pets (dogs, cats, birds, etc.)

Embedded and indexed using sentence-transformers with Chroma for fast retrieval

ðŸ“¦ Dependencies
langchain, langchain_community, langchain_groq, langchain_huggingface

chromadb, faiss-cpu, sentence-transformers
